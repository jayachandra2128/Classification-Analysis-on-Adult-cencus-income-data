# Classification-Analysis-on-Adult-cencus-income-data

Objective of this Project is to build Classfication models using 4 different approaches and implement them on Adult cencus income data. Four models built in this Project are:

Pocket Algorithm
Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA)
Linear discriminant analysis(LDA)
Logistic Regression
Below is the step by step process followed for building and implementation of Classification models.

1) Data Visualization

2) Preprocessing of the data

3) Review of 4 Classification models

4) Implementation of Pocket algorithm.

5) Implementation of QDA.

6) Implementation of LDA.

7) Implementation of Logistic regression algorithm.

8) Experiment Pocket algorithm, QDA, LDA, Logistic regression on Classification data.

      a) Preparing data, Dividing data into train set and test set
      
      b) Training model on train data
      
      c) Applying on train data 
      
      d) Applying on test data
      
      e) Evaluation metrics confusion matrix, precision, recall, specificity, roc auc score, accuracy, f1 score   
         are calculated
      
      f) Plots for results
      
9) Classification model comparision
